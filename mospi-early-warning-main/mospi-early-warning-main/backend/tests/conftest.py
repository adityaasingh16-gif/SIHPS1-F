"""Hermetic test configuration.

The monitoring API reads its project data from MongoDB, and the security tests
written for the IDS layer talk to a live server on localhost:27017. Requiring
a running mongod just to run the suite makes it undeployable in CI and on a
fresh checkout, so we install mongomock's global client patch *before* the app
is imported and point the app at the in-memory server, doing by hand what the
lifespan hook does against a real one.

The patch has to happen before ``app.database`` is imported: that module builds
its ``MongoClient`` at import time, and later imports (``app.main``,
``app.mongo_store``) bind the resulting handle. Importing anything from ``app``
above the patch would bind a real client and every request would then fail to
connect.
